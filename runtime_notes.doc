The append method, although marginally slower with the smaller arrays, it would still be the better method to use. This is becuase its still very quick with small arrays, but its performance impoves as the array grows. This is because append is simply adding a value onto the end of the array. Whereas insert appends to the front of the array and has to shuffle all existing values up by one index. This makes the insert methods execution time grow each iteration, slowing it down.
